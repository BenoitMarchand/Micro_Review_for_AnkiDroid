/**
 * "Change the card at every unlock": when a lock session ends without an answer, another due card is shown at
 * the next lock. AnkiDroid's API can't skip a card without a review, so the app rotates through a set of due
 * cards itself (the first ones of the selected decks, in review order); the skipped cards stay due in
 * AnkiDroid. After an answer, the first card comes back, and the next due card joins the set.
 * Kept free of Android dependencies so it can be unit tested.
