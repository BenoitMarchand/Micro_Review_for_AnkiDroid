/**
 * Picks the deck the next card comes from: decks are tried in priority order, and each deck is scanned up to
 * its number of due cards, so it is only passed over once all its due cards were skipped, or when nothing is
 * due. Kept free of Android dependencies so it can be unit tested.
 *
 * The cost of AnkiDroid's due-card query grows with the number of cards asked for (about 30 ms for 1 card,
 * 85 ms for 10, 200 ms for 40, measured in #21), so each deck is scanned progressively: 1 card, then 10, then
 * all its due cards.
